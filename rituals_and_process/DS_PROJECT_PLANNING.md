# Data Science Project Timeline Estimates

## Purpose

This document provides practical, industry-informed estimates for the time required to progress through the first three stages of the Data Science Process Framework: Problem Framing & Dataset Development, Baseline Modeling, and Advanced Modeling. It is designed to help with project planning, sprint estimation, and stakeholder communication.

---

## Estimated Timeline for Data Science Steps 0–2

### Step 0: Problem Framing, Hypothesis, Dataset Development, and Metrics

**Typical Duration:** **1–3 weeks**

- **1 week** if the problem is well-defined, data is accessible, and stakeholders are engaged.
- **Up to 3 weeks** if there’s ambiguity in business goals, fragmented data sources, or significant data cleaning/quality evaluation is needed.
- **Key accelerators:** Clear business objectives, existing data pipelines, and stakeholder availability.

---

### Step 1: Baseline, Heuristics, and Simple Models

**Typical Duration:** **1–2 weeks**

- **1 week** if data is clean and a baseline can be quickly implemented (e.g., rule-based, logistic regression, or simple statistics).
- **Up to 2 weeks** if additional feature engineering or exploratory data analysis is required to establish a meaningful baseline.
- **Key accelerators:** Prior experience with similar problems, reusable code/templates, and a well-prepared dataset.

---

### Step 2: Advanced Modeling, Quantified Business Impact, and Safeguards

**Typical Duration:** **2–4 weeks**

- **2 weeks** for initial advanced model development, tuning, and evaluation if the problem is straightforward and the baseline is well-understood.
- **Up to 4 weeks** if:
  - Multiple modeling approaches must be explored,
  - Significant error analysis and iteration are needed,
  - Additional data/features are required,
  - Business impact analysis and stakeholder review are extensive.
- **Key accelerators:** Automated pipelines, a robust feature store, and clear baseline results.

## Summary Table

| Step   | Typical Duration | Notes                                                        |
|--------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0      | 1–3 weeks        | Problem framing, data quality, gold/smoke test, metrics      |
| 1      | 1–2 weeks        | Baseline/heuristics, error analysis, smoke test validation   |
| 2      | 2–4 weeks        | Advanced modeling, error analysis, business impact, safeguards|

**Total (Steps 0–2):** *~4–9 weeks* for a moderately complex project.

## Additional Considerations

- **Data availability** is the single biggest factor—if data is not ready, timelines can double.
- **Stakeholder engagement** can speed up or slow down problem framing and business impact validation.
- **Team experience** and **tooling maturity** (e.g., automated pipelines, feature stores) can significantly reduce time spent on repetitive tasks.
- **Regulatory or compliance requirements** (e.g., in healthcare or finance) may add time for documentation and review.

## Agile/Sprint Planning Tips

- Break phases into 1–2 week sprints with clear, incremental deliverables (e.g., EDA report, baseline results, first advanced model).
- **Handle unknowns and uncertainty:**  
  When approaching a decision point with unresolved questions or dependencies, explicitly call out these unknowns in sprint planning.  
  - **Recommendation:**  
    - Timebox the work leading up to the decision point.
    - Define clear criteria for what must be learned or delivered before progressing.
    - Plan a follow-up sprint to address next steps once the decision point is reached and uncertainty is resolved.
    - Communicate risks and dependencies to stakeholders early and often.
- Early and continuous stakeholder feedback helps prevent rework and scope creep.
- Use retrospectives to identify bottlenecks and update future estimates based on actual experience.

## Practical Stakeholder Engagement Practices

Early and continuous stakeholder feedback, as well as proactive risk and dependency communication, are critical but often challenging in practice. Here are actionable tips to incorporate into your workflow:

- **Schedule Regular Check-Ins:**  
  Set up recurring meetings or touchpoints (weekly or bi-weekly) with stakeholders to share progress, intermediate results, and barriers. Use these sessions to clarify expectations, gather feedback, and realign priorities if needed.

- **Document and Share Progress:**  
  Maintain a running log or summary of key decisions, assumptions, and results. Share this with stakeholders so they understand the rationale behind your analysis and modeling choices.

- **Visualize and Demo Early:**  
  Use visualizations, dashboards, or simple demos to make results accessible to non-technical stakeholders. Demo-driven updates help stakeholders see tangible progress and provide context for feedback.

- **Align on Terms and Metrics:**  
  At project start, co-define key terms, success metrics, and deliverables. Revisit these definitions as the project evolves to ensure alignment and avoid misunderstandings.

- **Feedback Funnels:**  
  Use structured forms, feedback platforms, or shared documents to collect and prioritize stakeholder input efficiently.

- **Expectation Management:**  
  At each decision point, clearly communicate what is known, what is unknown, and what risks or dependencies exist. If you cannot plan further until a decision is made, make this explicit in sprint planning and stakeholder updates.

- **Empower and Onboard Stakeholders:**  
  Bring stakeholders into the process early—co-create problem statements, review data together, and share ownership of the outcomes. This builds trust and increases buy-in.

- **Adapt Communication Style:**  
  Tailor your communication to the audience: use business language for executives, technical details for engineering, and visual storytelling for broader audiences.

## In Summary

A data scientist (or small team) can typically progress from business framing through advanced modeling in **about 1–2 months**, assuming moderate complexity and reasonable data readiness. Complex or high-stakes projects may take longer, while well-scoped, data-rich projects can move even faster.

Proactive, structured stakeholder engagement and transparent risk communication are essential for successful delivery and should be baked into every sprint and project phase.

## Practical Practice: Stakeholder Review Cadence

A highly practical practice to embed in your data science framework-addressing the challenges of early and continuous stakeholder feedback and risk communication-is to **schedule and timebox regular, structured stakeholder review sessions as part of your project plan**.

### **Recommended Practice: Stakeholder Review Cadence**

- **Establish a recurring meeting (e.g., bi-weekly or at the end of each sprint)** dedicated to reviewing progress, sharing interim results (including visualizations and business-impact narratives), and openly discussing risks and unknowns.
- **Prepare for each session by translating technical results into business terms and “what if” scenarios** that show potential impact in stakeholder language (e.g., “If we implement this, we could save $X” rather than “the model is 85% accurate”).
- **Explicitly call out current risks, blockers, and dependencies**-even if the only update is that you’re still investigating or waiting on data.
- **Invite feedback and questions, and document all stakeholder input and decisions** in a shared location (e.g., project wiki, sprint board, or shared document).
- **Use these sessions to align on next steps and reset expectations as needed**, especially when approaching a decision point with uncertainty.

> “Frequent, honest and open lines of communication between cross-functional teams and stakeholders are absolutely essential for a successful project... Having all data science team members, including junior team members, at the table from day one ensures we maintain a holistic view of our projects.”

**Why this works:**  
- It creates a predictable, low-friction channel for feedback and risk discussion, so you’re not left waiting for ad hoc responses.
- It helps stakeholders feel ownership and keeps them engaged, making it easier to surface and resolve issues early.
- It ensures risks and dependencies are not just communicated, but also tracked and acted upon.

**How to add this to your framework:**  
Include a line in your process documentation (perhaps in Section 0 or as a cross-cutting principle):

> **Stakeholder Review Cadence:**  
> Schedule recurring stakeholder review sessions (at least once per sprint) to share progress, translate results into business impact, discuss risks and dependencies, and collect actionable feedback. Document all input and decisions to ensure alignment and transparency.

This simple, structured practice will help you consistently achieve the “early and continuous feedback” and “risk communication” goals that are so critical to successful data science projects.
