## **Section 0: Problem Framing, Gold Standard, and Metrics**

### **Purpose**
- Ensure shared understanding of the business problem.
- Establish objective criteria and a consistent evaluation framework.

### **Steps**
1. **Define the Business Problem**
   - Collaborate with stakeholders to clarify objectives, constraints, and desired outcomes.
2. **Formulate Initial Hypotheses**
   - Develop testable statements about expected patterns or model behaviors.
3. **Define Gold Standard Dataset**
   - Identify or curate a representative, high-quality labeled dataset.
4. **Select Evaluation Metrics**
   - Choose metrics that directly reflect business priorities (e.g., precision, recall, cost savings, customer retention).
   - Document how each metric ties to business impact.
5. **Decision Point:** *Are the problem, dataset, and metrics well-defined and agreed upon?*
   - **Criteria to Proceed:** Stakeholder sign-off; dataset and metrics are feasible, relevant, and reproducible.

## **Section 1: Baseline, Heuristics, and Simple Models**

### **Purpose**
- Establish a quick, interpretable reference point for performance.

### **Steps**
1. **Implement Baseline and/or Heuristic Models**
   - Use the gold standard dataset and agreed-upon metrics.
2. **Evaluate Performance**
   - Assess baseline results using business metrics.
3. **Error Analysis**
   - Identify where and why the baseline fails.
4. **Decision Point:** *Is the baseline sufficient for business needs?*
   - **Criteria to Proceed:** If yes, deploy; if not, move to advanced modeling.

## **Section 2: Advanced Modeling, Quantified Business Impact, and Safeguards**

### **Purpose**
- Build and refine models to outperform the baseline and deliver quantifiable business value.

### **Steps**
1. **Develop and Tune Advanced Models**
   - Use the same gold standard dataset and metrics.
2. **Evaluate Against Baseline**
   - Compare model performance to baseline using business metrics.
3. **Error Analysis**
   - Analyze residual errors; identify patterns, biases, or business risks.
4. **Quantify Business Impact**
   - Translate improvements in metrics to concrete business outcomes (e.g., “A 2% increase in recall reduces annual churn by X customers, saving $Y”).
5. **Decision Point:** *Does the model provide sufficient, quantifiable business value?*
   - **Criteria to Proceed:** 
     - Model demonstrates clear, measurable improvement on business metrics.
     - Business impact is quantified and aligns with stakeholder-defined thresholds.
     - If the model meets some but not all business requirements, **define and implement additional heuristics or safeguards** (e.g., rule-based overrides, thresholds, human-in-the-loop checks) to mitigate risk in production.
   - **Hypothesis Refinement:** If business value or error analysis reveals new insights, refine hypotheses and iterate on model development, but maintain consistent evaluation criteria unless re-framing is justified and agreed upon.

## **Section 3: Productionization, Monitoring, and Lifecycle Management**

### **Purpose**
- Operationalize the solution for robust, maintainable, and continuously valuable deployment.

### **Steps**
1. **Feature Store Integration**
   - Register and version features used in modeling for reproducibility and consistency in production.
2. **Model Registry**
   - Register and version the production-ready model.
3. **Deployment Planning**
   - Define how and where the model will be deployed (batch, real-time, API, etc.).
   - Establish inference cadence (e.g., score entire population, or subset based on heuristics).
4. **Safeguards Implementation**
   - Integrate any necessary production heuristics, business rules, or human-in-the-loop mechanisms identified in Section 2.
5. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement model monitoring for:
     - **Performance metrics** (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, business KPIs)
     - **Feature drift** (input distribution changes)
     - **Concept drift** (target distribution changes)
     - **Data quality issues**
6. **Retraining Pipeline**
   - Automate data collection, model retraining, validation, and redeployment based on drift or performance triggers.
7. **Ongoing Error Analysis**
   - Continuously analyze errors and model performance in production to identify new risks or opportunities for improvement.
8. **Lifecycle Management**
   - Establish criteria and cadence for model and feature updates, rollback procedures, and documentation updates.

## **Key Principles**

- **Consistency:** Gold standard dataset and metrics are stable across all modeling phases.
- **Business Impact:** Always quantify and communicate business value, not just metric improvement.
- **Safeguards:** If the model does not meet all business requirements, supplement with heuristics or rules in production.
- **Operational Readiness:** Productionization covers feature/model versioning, deployment strategy, monitoring, drift detection, and retraining pipelines.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Ongoing error analysis and lifecycle management ensure sustained value and responsiveness to changing data or business needs.
