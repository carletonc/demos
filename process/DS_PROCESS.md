# Data Science Process Framework

## Purpose

This document provides a practical, sprint-friendly framework for systematically approaching data science problems. It ensures business alignment, data quality, reproducibility, and robust deployment. The process is broken into clear sections with decision points, error analysis, and safeguards, enabling efficient delivery and continuous improvement.

## Section 0: Problem Framing, Hypothesis, Dataset Development, and Business Metrics

**Purpose:**  
Ensure a shared, actionable understanding of the business problem and the data foundation for modeling.

### Steps

1. **Define the Business Problem**
    - Identify technical stakeholders & project lead.
    - Collaborate with stakeholders on objectives, constraints, and desired outcomes.
2. **Formulate Initial Hypotheses**
    - Develop testable statements about expected relationships or behaviors.
3. **Stakeholder Review Cadence**
    - Schedule recurring stakeholder review sessions (at least once per sprint) to share progress, translate results into business impact, discuss risks and dependencies, and collect actionable feedback. Document all input and decisions to ensure alignment and transparency.
3. **Dataset Development**
    - **Data Collection:** Identify, acquire, and integrate raw data sources.
    - **Data Quality Evaluation:** Assess completeness, consistency, accuracy, timeliness, and relevance.
    - **Data Cleaning:** Address missing values, outliers, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
    - **Documentation:** Record data lineage, assumptions, and known limitations.
4. **Define Gold Standard and Smoke Test Datasets**
    - Curate a labeled, representative, high-quality dataset for training, validation, and testing (gold standard).
    - Create a small, diverse "smoke test" holdout set for manual, intuitive validation throughout the process.
    - Ensure unbiased sampling and coverage of relevant scenarios.
5. **Select Evaluation Metrics**
    - Choose metrics that map directly to business priorities.
    - Document how each metric ties to business impact.
6. **Decision Point:** *Are the problem, hypotheses, dataset, and metrics well-defined and agreed upon?*
    - **Criteria:** Stakeholder sign-off; reproducible data and metrics framework.

## Section 1: Baseline, Heuristics, and Simple Models

**Purpose:**  
Establish a reference point and validate the data pipeline.

### Steps

1. **Implement Baseline/Heuristic Models**
    - Use the gold standard dataset and agreed-upon metrics.
2. **Evaluate Performance**
    - Assess results with business metrics.
3. **Error Analysis**
    - Identify systematic failures or data issues.
4. **Manual Validation with Smoke Test Dataset**
    - Run baseline model(s) on the smoke test dataset to check if predictions "make sense."
5. **Decision Point:** *Is the baseline sufficient for business needs?*
    - **Criteria:** If yes, deploy; if not, proceed to advanced modeling.
    - **If Not:** Consider if more data or additional features are needed before advancing.

## Section 2: Advanced Modeling, Quantified Business Impact, and Safeguards

**Purpose:**  
Build, assess, and refine models to outperform the baseline and deliver quantifiable business value.

### Steps

1. **Dataset Expansion (if necessary)**
    - If error analysis or baseline results indicate, expand the dataset or engineer new features before proceeding to advanced modeling.
2. **Develop and Tune Advanced Models**
    - Use the gold standard dataset and metrics.
3. **Evaluate Against Baseline**
    - Compare performance to baseline using business metrics.
4. **Error Analysis**
    - Analyze residual errors; identify business risks or data issues.
5. **Manual Validation with Smoke Test Dataset**
    - Run advanced models on the smoke test dataset to ensure predictions remain reasonable and interpretable.
6. **Quantify Business Impact**
    - Translate metric improvements to concrete business outcomes (e.g., cost savings, reduced churn).
7. **Decision Point:** *Does the model provide sufficient, quantifiable business value?*
    - **Criteria:** Measurable improvement; business impact quantified.
    - **Safeguards:** If the model meets some but not all requirements, define and implement additional heuristics or business rules.
    - **Hypothesis Refinement:** Refine and iterate if needed, but maintain consistent evaluation unless justified.
    - **If Not:** Consider if more data, additional features, or further data quality improvements are required before continuing.

## Section 3: Productionization, Monitoring, and Lifecycle Management

**Purpose:**  
Operationalize the solution, ensuring robustness, maintainability, and sustained value.

### Steps

1. **Feature Store Integration**
    - Register and version features for reproducibility.
2. **Model Registry**
    - Register and version the production-ready model.
3. **Deployment Planning**
    - Define deployment method and inference cadence (full population or subset via heuristics).
4. **Safeguards Implementation**
    - Integrate production heuristics, business rules, or human-in-the-loop mechanisms.
5. **Monitoring Setup**
    - Implement monitoring for:
        - **Performance metrics**
        - **Feature drift**
        - **Concept drift**
        - **Data quality**
6. **Retraining Pipeline**
    - Automate data collection, retraining, validation, and redeployment.
7. **Ongoing Error Analysis**
    - Continuously analyze errors and performance in production.
8. **Lifecycle Management**
    - Establish procedures for model/feature updates, rollback, and documentation.

## Key Principles

- **Dataset development and data quality evaluation** are explicit, foundational steps before any modeling.
- **Gold standard and smoke test datasets** are defined early and used consistently for both quantitative and manual validation.
- **Consistency** in gold standard dataset and metrics ensures comparability across all experiments.
- **Safeguards** and heuristics are integrated if business requirements are only partially met.
- **Continuous monitoring and error analysis** ensure long-term model reliability and business value.
- **Iterative data improvement:** At any modeling stage, acquiring more data or features may be necessary to address gaps or improve performance.
